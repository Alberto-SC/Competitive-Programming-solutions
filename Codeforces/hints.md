# Complexity

- If problem is check for all multiples of a number in [1,n] and this multiples donÂ´t exed maxn complexity is (maxn log(maxn))
- Merge many sets can be do it in n logn if we insert elements of the minor set to the mayor set
- Strings? Do you made a suffix array or suffix tree 
- Graphs? shortes Path with two variables or many types of edges? try to clone graph
- try to decompose the formula
