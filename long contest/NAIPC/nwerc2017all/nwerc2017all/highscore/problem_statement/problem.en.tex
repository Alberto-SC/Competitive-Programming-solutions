MÃ¥rten and Simon enjoy playing the popular board game Seven Wonders, and have just finished a match. It is now time
to tally the scores.

One of the ways to score in Seven Wonders is through the use of \emph{Science}. During the game, the players
may collect a number of Science tokens of three different types: \emph{Cog}, \emph{Tablet}, and \emph{Compass}.
If a player has $a$ Cogs, $b$ Tablets and $c$ Compasses, that player gets $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 7 \cdot \min(a, b, c)$
points.

However, the scoring is complicated by the concept of \emph{Wildcard Science} tokens. For each Wildcard Science token
a player has, she may count that as one of the three ordinary types of Science tokens. For instance, the first player in Sample Input 1 has
$2$ Cogs, $1$ Tablet, $2$ Compasses, and $1$ Wildcard Science, so could thus choose to have the distributions
$(3, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 1, 3)$ of Cogs, Tablets and Compasses, respectively.
The possible scores for this player are then $3^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 7 \cdot 1 = 21$, $2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 7 \cdot 2 = 26$
and $2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 7 \cdot 1 = 21$ depending on how the Wildcard Science is assigned.
Thus, the maximum score for this player is $26$.

Given the number of tokens each player in the game has, compute the maximum possible score that each of them
can achieve if they assign their Wildcard Science tokens optimally.



\section*{Input}
The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item One line with an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 7$), the number of players in the game.
  \item $n$ lines, each with four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$
        ($0 \le a, b, c, d \le 10^9$), giving the number of Cog, Tablet, Compass, and Wildcard Science tokens of a player.
%        The $i$th line with the number of Cog, Tablet, Compass and Wildcard Science tokens of the $i$th player in the game.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}
For each player, in the same order they are given in the input, output the maximum score the player may get.
