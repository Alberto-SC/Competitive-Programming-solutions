The new computers are here! However, we made a mistake during the order: we
thought we were ordering machines with qubits; in fact, we ordered several
hundred computers powered by cube-bits.

The programs and data we had ready were prepared in base 10. To feed the data
into the new computer, which uses a cubic system of counting, we will need to
convert it to base 3 first.

Write a program to convert a stream of decimal numbers into ternary format, so
they fit the new system's input bus.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One line with an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), the size of the data stream.
    \item $n$ lines with one decimal integer $v_i$ ($0 \le v < 3^{20}$), the decimal
representation of the $i$-th integer in the data stream.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Output}

Output $n$ lines, giving the numbers converted to base-$3$, in the same order as given.
In the interest of conserving disk space, do not print leading zeroes.
