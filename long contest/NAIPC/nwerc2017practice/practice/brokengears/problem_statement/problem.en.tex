The mechanical Turk was an 18th-century sham robot designed to give the
illusion of artificial intelligence by playing chess. More importantly, the Turk
inspired us to make our own fake robot that gives the illusion of real
intelligence by solving programming contest problems.

We put some gears on axles inside an uncovered panel to make our machine look
more realistic. Since the gears are just for visual effect, they have been
placed so as to create an impressive meshing pattern; however, the placement
is without any regard to gear ratios or turning direction, so it is possible that
none of the gears can really move.

It is guaranteed that every axle was connected to every other axle by meshing,
either directly or indirectly. Two axles $a$ and $b$ are said to have directly
meshing gears if their distance from one another is equal to the sum of the
radii of their gears ($d_{ab} = r_{g_a} + r_{g_b}$).

Sadly, the gears fell off our machine. We think we collected all of them back up
again, but now we are not sure which should go back on which axle. Please find a
way of putting the gears on the axles to make them mesh the way they did
originally.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One line with an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$), the number of gears and axles.
	\item One line with $n$ integers $r_1 \ldots r_n$ ($1 \le r_i \le 10^8$ for each $i$), the radius of each gear.
	\item One line with an integer $m$ ($n-1 \le m \le 10^5$), the number of pairs of axles to mesh.
	\item $m$ lines with three integers $a_i, b_i, d_i$
($1 \le a < b \le n$; $1 \le d \le 10^8$), the indices of two axles that were previously meshed,
and the distance between them, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}

If the machine can be fixed with the given gears, give any one valid matching
by outputting $n$ integers $g_1{\ldots}g_n$, where $g_i$ is the 1-based index of the gear
to put on the $i$-th axle. Otherwise, output ``\texttt{impossible}''.
